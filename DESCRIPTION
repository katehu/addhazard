Description: Contains tools to fit the additive hazards model to data from a cohort,
    random sampling, two-phase Bernoulli sampling and two-phase finite population sampling,
    as well as calibration tool to incorporate phase I auxiliary information into the
    two-phase data model fitting.  This package provides regression parameter estimates and
    their model-based and robust standard errors. It also offers tools to make prediction of
    individual specific hazards.
