Description: Contains tools to fit the additive hazards model to a cohort 
    study, a case-cohort study, or a general two-phase sampling study. It allows weight
    calibration to incorporate additional auxiliary information from the full cohort
    into the estimation procedure in a case-cohort study or from the phase I sample 
    in a two-phase sampling study. It can be used for both Bernoulli and
    finite population sampling. This package provides regression parameter estimates
    and their model-based and robust standard errors. It also offers tools to make prediction
    of individual specific hazards at a specified time.
